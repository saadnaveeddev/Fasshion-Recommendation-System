# Fashion-Recommendation-System
Presenting my content-based fashion recommendation system, utilizing machine learning to suggest personalized clothing and accessories based on users' style preferences and item features.

Let's discuss our project

main.ipynb

In the "main.ipynb" file, I've crafted a fashion recommendation system using a pre-trained ResNet50 model from ImageNet. This notebook showcases the design and development process, incorporating deep learning techniques to create a content-based recommendation system that suggests fashion items based on their visual features.

test.ipynb

The "test.ipynb" file contains testing procedures for the fashion recommendation system. This notebook provides insights into how the system performs in various scenarios and against different inputs. It ensures the reliability and accuracy of the recommendation model before deployment.

my_app.py

Within "my_app.py," I've encapsulated the recommendation model within a Streamlit web application. By running this script, users can interact with the trained model in real-time. The app allows users to upload images of fashion items, and the embedded ResNet50 model responds by suggesting three visually similar fashion images, effectively bringing the recommendation system to life in a user-friendly way.
